Introduction
============
The Thermo program exists to calculate the thermodynamic and transport
properties of gases and gas mixtures.  Other similar codes use various 
cubic and non-cubic relationships, which add fidelity to the original
ideal gas law derived by Bolten in 1802. While these relationships can calculate
the pressure, temperature and density of a gas with relatively good accuracy, 
they are not able to facilitate ether calculation of other metrics such as specific heats
enthalpy, entropy, and many others.  This program will use the Helmholtz free energy
derivations to calculate all thermodynamic properties with greater accuracy than can 
be obtained with corrected ideal-gas law relationships.
